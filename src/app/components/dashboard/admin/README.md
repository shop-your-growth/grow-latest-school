## Contributing

### Code Standards
- Follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Write meaningful component and function documentation
- Follow the established naming conventions for components and files

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit messages (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branches from `develop` branch
2. Ensure all tests pass and no linting errors exist
3. Update documentation for any new features or changes
4. Request code reviews from at least one team member
5. Squash commits before merging to maintain a clean history

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations using `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Use virtualized lists for rendering large data sets
- Optimize component re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Implement code splitting for larger modules
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms for data processing

### State Management
- Use context providers for shared global state
- Keep component state localized when possible
- Implement custom hooks for reusable state logic
- Structure state to minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use reducers for complex state management

### API Interaction
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Use service layers to abstract API interaction
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Implement retries for transient errors
- Add loading and error states for all API-dependent components

### Security Considerations
- Follow principle of least privilege for all API access
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use HTTP-only cookies for sensitive data
- Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities

### Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add ARIA attributes where appropriate
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies
